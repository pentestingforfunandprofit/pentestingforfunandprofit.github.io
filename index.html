      <h1>Penetration testing Java applications</h1>
      <h2>for fun and profit</h2>
      <p>Is a hands-on, practical course that covers a range of advanced attacks against Java applications. It runs for half a day, and is suitable for anyone with at least a basic understanding of Java and security.</p>

      <div id="about">
         <h2>About</h2>
         <p>The training has been developed and delivered by David Jorm, a security industry veteran. David has been involved in computer security since 1999, and has presented his research at conferences around the world. From 2011 to 2014 he acted as one of the main security engineers for Red Hat's Java middleware products. This exposed him to a wide range of Java vulnerabilities across commonly-used components. Being responsible for finding vulnerabilities, fixing vulnerabilities and implementing mechanisms in the software development life-cycle to minimize security risks has given David a deep understanding of Java application security from all angles. The training draws on that experience, showing participants how to understand, identify, exploit and resolve a range of high-impact and lesser-known security vulnerabilities in Java applications.</p>
        <p>The training focuses on understanding categories of vulnerabilities and using code inspection to find instances of them. Well documented vulnerabilities such as XSS, CSRF and SQL injection are not covered. The training tries instead to present more novel material, that is understandable by beginners, but will teach even seasoned pen testers some useful techniques. The training consists of the following modules:</p>
<ul>
<li>Authentication bypasses</li>
<li>Path traversal</li>
<li>SSL issues</li>
<li>XXE (general and parameter entities)</li>
<li>RCE: XML deserialization</li>
<li>RCE: binary deserialization</li>
<li>RCE: XSL extensions</li>
<li>RCE: EL interpolation</li>
</ul>
        <p>Each module includes an explanation of the issue in general, a presentation of a relevant vulnerability found by the trainer, and then a hands-on challenge to find and exploit a similar vulnerability in a sample application. The sample application is <a href="https://github.com/pentestingforfunandprofit/webbank">freely available on github</a>.</p>
